So What you need to run a project 

1-composer update if show any error use this comment 

 php artisan route:clear

 php artisan config:clear

 php artisan cache:clear

2- Datebase name blog / go to PHPMyAdmin and import database File Blog.sql

3- open project from cmd and enter PHP artisan serve 

4-to enter to Home page http://127.0.0.1:8000/ no need to login 

5- to enter to dashboard http://127.0.0.1:8000/login or http://127.0.0.1:8000/back

6- to login Enter email: admin@gmail.com  password: 12345678 this for admin you should use it if need to access to dashboard with full permission  because any new user needs permission from admin 

7- enjoy in website :)
